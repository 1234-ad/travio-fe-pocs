# GitHub Version Control Guidelines

These guidelines define how our team should work with GitHub to keep our workflow consistent, clean, and efficient.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Branching Rules

- **`main` branch**
  - Always stable and production-ready.
  - No direct commits allowed â€“ use Pull Requests (PRs).

- **`develop` branch**
  - Latest integration branch.
  - All features merge here before going to `main`.

- **Feature branches** (`feature/<name>`)
  - For new features, enhancements, or bug fixes.
  - Create from `develop`.
  - Example: `feature/login-ui`, `feature/api-auth`.

- **Hotfix branches** (`hotfix/<name>`)
  - For urgent production fixes.
  - Create from `main`.

## ðŸ”¹ Standard Workflow

1. **Start Work**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name origin/develop
Make Changes & Commit

Keep commits small and meaningful.

Follow Conventional Commits:

feat: â†’ new feature

fix: â†’ bug fix

chore: â†’ configs / cleanup

docs: â†’ documentation

refactor: â†’ improvements without behavior change

Example:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT-based login"
Sync Before Push

bash
Copy code
git pull --rebase origin develop
Push Your Branch

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Raise a Pull Request (PR)

PR target: feature/... â†’ develop (or main if hotfix).

PR title: short & descriptive.

PR description should include:

âœ… What the change does

âœ… Why it is needed

âœ… Any screenshots or test notes

Review & Merge

At least 1 reviewer approval required.

Resolve conflicts before merge.

Use Squash & Merge to keep history clean.

Cleanup

bash
Copy code
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
ðŸ”¹ Best Practices
âœ” Always pull the latest changes before starting work.

âœ” Keep PRs small, focused, and easy to review.

âœ” Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files.

âœ” Run tests and lint checks locally before pushing.

âœ” Use Draft PRs for early feedback.

âœ” Document significant changes in the PR description.

âš¡ Following these guidelines ensures:

Consistent workflow across the team

Fewer merge conflicts

Clean and understandable history

Faster reviews and deployments
